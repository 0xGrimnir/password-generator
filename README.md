# Random Password Generator
Part of my "10 Minute Projects" series in which I spend between 5-10 minutes a day writing simple programs to keep my skills sharp. This project is a simple 8 line password generator in Python. 

Don't actually use this to generate passwords; the random function isn't actually "random". This is just a small project I did for fun.
